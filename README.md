# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor


This repository is a code refactor for UWEX Coding Bootcamp. The refactor aids accessability, makes the code much easier to read, and removes redundancy.

I refactored the code by
- adding comments to both the HTML and CSS
- adding a descriptive title
- correcting the links in the navigation bar
- adding alt attributes to images where appropriate
- changing the HTML elements to be semantic
- consolidating the CSS style declarations
